How To Play The Classic Arcade Game?

You are the player and you have to reach the water. But be careful! On your way to your destination there are poisonous bugs! Move your player up, down, left and right to avoid the bugs. If you touch the bug, the game resets, your player comes back to the initial position and you have to start again. 

<strong>When you reach the water, you win!</strong>
